**Low-Level Design (LLD) Solutions Repository**
Overview
Welcome to the Low-Level Design (LLD) Solutions repository! This repository contains a collection of design problems and their implementations. The aim is to provide a comprehensive set of solutions to common LLD problems, focusing on coding best practices, concurrency handling, and design patterns.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

src: Contains source code for all the LLD implementations.

Each problem has its own folder named after the problem.
Subfolders within each problem folder may include:
src/: Java classes implementing the solution.
test/: Unit tests for validating the implementations.(To be Added)
docs: Contains problem statements, solution approaches, and design considerations in Markdown files.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

**Problem List** (Needs to be updated with the list of all the problems )
Below is a list of LLD problems covered in this repository. Each problem folder includes:

A detailed explanation of the problem.
The design approach used.
A Java implementation.
